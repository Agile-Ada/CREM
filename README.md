###Convention Resource Event Management

##Purpose

This web app will help a small team of convention organizers schedule a huge number of events for a highly-diverse multi-track convention, such as Penguicon, identifying all resource conflicts.

Penguicon has about 500 events over a single weekend, in about seventeen different tracks, each track with its own organizer.

For years, Penguicon has planned its schedule using two systems, and kept them in sync manually.

In a spreadsheet, we represented rooms as columns, and times as rows, so we can catch conflicts. But that doesn't store the event description, the topics, whether or not it is "just an idea"/"probably happening"/"confirmed", and other important data.

A database allowed us to store and present a schedule with all the details associated with each event. But the databases we have used could not catch conflicts in which two events are scheduled in the same room at the same time, or a presenter in two places at one time, or duplicated events or presenters.

We are creating C.R.E.M. because we need one solution which stores all the data we use, and also alerts us to conflicts.

##Prerequisites

To develop for this project, you will need `node`, `grunt`, and `bower`. Download `node` from `https://nodejs.org/en/download/` and install it.

Then use this on the command line for node package manager (npm) to install bower and grunt: `npm install -g bower grunt-cli`
